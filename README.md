Creates a file system in google drive for a given course using drive APIs
The program create-folders.py takes a few inputs from the user, such as the number of assignments and lecture frequency,
then creates the filing system using those inputs.

The program google.py is a standard program used to check google cloud authentification and connect to the users google account.

Please note: The code showcased publicly will not run, as the file "credentials.json" is missing. This is for security reasons, as that file would allow anyone with access to connect to my google account.
